# EDD2019 Hands-On Neural Networks

## Getting Started

1. Install *python 3.7.2* from here (bottom of the page, files section): https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-372/
2. Download and install *Anaconda* for *Windows* using *Python 3.7* version from here: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section
3. After installing Anaconda, press the *Windows key*, type *anaconda prompt* and run it as *admin*
4. In the *Anaconda Prompt* we will install the packages used in this tutorial. For this, type the following commands:

  - *conda install tensorflow=1.13.1*
  - *conda install keras=2.2.4*
  - *conda install matplotlib=3.1.1*
  - *conda install numpy=1.16.5*
  - *conda install pandas=0.25.1*
  
5. Press the *Windows key*, type *jupyter notebook* and run the application. If everything works as expected, then a new browser tab will open automatically in which we can see the Jupyter Notebook running on the localhost
6. Clone or download this repository
7. In the Jupyter Nootebook navigate to the location of the cloned or downloaded repository and click on the *AlexNet_FoodClassification.ipynb* file. This will open a new tab containing a notebook with some package imports, some predefined parameters, folder paths and helper functions

The notebook consists of a sequence of *cells*. A cell is a multiline text input field, and its contents can be executed by using *Shift-Enter*, or by clicking the "Run" button in the toolbar. You can *run all* the cells by clicking the *>>* button in the toolbar.

After running the first cell (you will have to wait a few sencods to import all the packages) below the cell you should see the following text: *Using TensorFlow backend.*
After running the second cell you should get the following list of pacakges and versions:
           *['builtins',
           'builtins',
           'tensorflow',
           '1.13.1',
           'keras',
           '2.2.4',
           'matplotlib.pyplot',
           'numpy',
           '1.16.5',
           'pandas',
           '0.25.1',
           'os',
           'types',
           'matplotlib',
           '3.1.1']*
